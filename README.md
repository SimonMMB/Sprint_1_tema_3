Arrays

=> 16-JAN-25: LEVELS 2 & 3

ðŸ“„ EXERCISES DESCRIPTION

LEVEL 1
- Exercise 1
Create an array. Add 5 integers. Display them on the screen one by one.
- Exercise 2
$X = array (10, 20, 30, 40, 50,60);
Display the size. Delete an element. Normalize the integer keys. Display the size.
- Exercise 3
Function: receives as parameters an array of words and a character. Returns true if all the words in the array have the character passed as the second parameter.
- Exercise 4
Associative array: information about yourself: name, age, email, favorite food.

LEVEL 2
- Exercise 1
Create a program that contains two arrays of integers/floats. Once created, display the result of:
    * The intersection of the two arrays (numbers in common).
    * The mixture of the two arrays.
- Exercise 2
Create a program that lists the grades of the students in a class. For this we will have to use an associative array where the key will be the name of each student. Each student will have 5 grades (valued from 0 to 10). Also, create a function that, given the grades of all the students, shows us both the average grade of each student and the average grade of the entire class.

LEVEL 3
- Exercise 1
Given an array of integers, write a program that: Returns each value in the array cubed using the array_map()function.
- Exercise 2
Given an array of strings, write a program that: Returns an array containing only strings that have an even number of characters using the array_filter() function.
- Exercise 3
Given an array of integers, write a program that returns the sum of the integers in the array that are prime using the array_reduce() function.
